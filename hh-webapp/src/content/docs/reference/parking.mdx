### Parking

There is a very limited amount of parking available around Harvard, so we highly recommend hackers to get dropped off on a street close to the SOCH or commute to the venue using public transport.

Please refer to this address if youâ€™re looking for nearby locations for drop-off: [Link](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Student+Organization+Center+at+Hilles+(SOCH)/@42.3806056,-71.1251818,111m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e3776b107f6f61:0x370c9c0891362ac9!8m2!3d42.3810179!4d-71.1249813!16s%2Fg%2F1pp2x7mdx?entry=tts&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkyMi4wKgBIAVAD)
