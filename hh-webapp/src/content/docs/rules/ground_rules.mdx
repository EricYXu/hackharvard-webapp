<Card title="Respect the space." icon="codePen">
	Participants in hackathons held on Harvardâ€™s campus are expected to uphold the highest standards of respect for university property and facilities. All event spaces, furnishings, equipment, and resources must be used responsibly and for their intended purposes. Attendees should ensure that work areas remain clean and orderly, and that any borrowed items are handled with care and returned in proper condition. Movement of furniture or use of technical equipment should only occur with prior authorization from event staff or Harvard personnel. Any damage, misuse, or unauthorized access to restricted areas is strictly prohibited and may result in removal from the event, as well as referral to university authorities for further action. These expectations are in place to maintain a safe, professional, and respectful environment.
