Please read the information regarding judging criteria and scheduling provided below carefully.

<Card title="Judging Criteria" icon="magnifier">
	All projects will be judged based on four criteria. Each category is weighted the same, but a bias in the following listed order will be used to break ties.
1. Innovation, Creativity and Impact
2. Technical Complexity
3. Functionality and Usability
4. Teamwork and Collaboration and Learning

**Note:** These are merely general principles that judges will be assessing projects on. These are NOT the tracks for which specific prizes will be given out.

<Card title="Timing" icon="seti:clock">
	Expo judging will be at **9:45 AM on Sunday**. Each team will be assigned a table and judges will come to their tables and ask them about their project. 

	Some teams may be selected for panel judging where they present in front of a panel of judges. Not getting selected for panel judging is NOT an indication of the teamâ€™s score. Being selected for panel judging is simply an indication that not enough of the panel judges have seen the project and no one was able to vouch for the team directly.
